WiNGHacks is the University of Florida (UF)'s first hackathon specifically created to uplift Women, Non-binary and Gender-nonconforming students in their technology journey. During the 36 hours of WiNGHacks, 180 hackers will learn new skills, network with their peers, and create innovative projects for a chance to win category prizes.

The goal of our hackathon is to create a welcoming learning and growing environment for underrepresented genders in the tech industry. We hope to remove the barrier of entry to these events for many people, especially first-time hackers, and help them reap the many benefits that hackathons bring.
